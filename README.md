## examples

Stephen Wolfram's 'elementary' cellular automata: https://opensofias.github.io/celluloid/#amount=256&page=0&neighbors=3&radix=2&seed=~cr6~

rule 105 on the rabbit sequence: https://opensofias.github.io/celluloid/#amount=1&page=105&neighbors=3&radix=2&seed=~rb15~

the start seed functions include

* ts: a single transition from 0s to 1s
* cr: a single 1 surrounded 0s
* dc: dragon curve sequcence
* tm: Thoe-Morse sequence
* kk: Kolakosky sequence (reduced by 1)
* rb: rabbit sequence (aka Fibonacci word)
* ct: Cantor set sequence
